Refused to load media from 'http://tts.baidu.com/text2audio?lan=en&ie=UTF-8&spd=5&text=Cannot%20GET%20/system-management' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "default-src 'none'". Note that 'media-src' was not explicitly set, so 'default-src' is used as a fallback.

webpack-dev-server --config webpack/webpack.config.dev.js --colors --history-api-fallback
